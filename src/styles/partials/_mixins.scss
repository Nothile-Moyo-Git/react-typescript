/* 
    Background gradient effect
    This hover effect creates an efficient and smooth gradient animation
    It is currently optimized for modern browsers by avoiding repainting
    It also takes advantage of the GPU as much as possible
    To use this, pass through your linear gradient and set the z-index of the parent to at least 1
    If you want to delay this animation, pass it to the parent using an inline style
    This can be great if you're rendering a list of cards and want to delay each animation
